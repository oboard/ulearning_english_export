I don't think that Billy is going to join you. He's upstairs playing on his computer.<br>W: He doesn't seem to leave his room much anymore, does he?<br>M: Not much. You're right. I bought that computer for him fifteen months ago for his thirteenth birthday. He's changed a lot since then. He doesn't even talk about anything else. And his mother and I don't understand him — not at all.<br>W: But don't you think that it's at least a little good for him?<br>M: No, I don't. I'm a little worried, to tell the truth. He has no other interests, he isn't doing well at school, and he doesn't even want to go to his classes.<br>W: Maybe I'll get my son Michael to talk to him about it.<br>M: It'd be nice if that would change things. I don't know what I'm going to do. Billy just seems to get worse and worse every day. But, maybe you should keep Michael away. I'd hate it if my son introduces him to computers.<br>W: Oh, Michael knows all about computers. All of the kids do these days. Computers can help them with their work and are an important part of their lives, especially if they plan to go to college.<br>M: He knows about computers, and doesn't spend all of his time on them? It'd be great if my son could learn to be like that. Please, have Michael talk to him.<br>W: Sure thing. But right now I have to take Michael to the football game.<br>M: OK, I'll see you later.<br>Q 6: How old is Billy?<br>Q 7: Why did Mr. Black buy the computer?<br>Q 8: How has Billy changed since he got the computer?<br>Q 9: Why doesn't Mrs. Stokes worry about her son Michael?<br>Q 10: How would Michael help Billy according to the conversation?<br>",

          "title": "<strong>Global Warming May Not End Up&nbsp;</strong><strong>Being Warm at All</strong><br> <br> Most scientists are now certain that global warming is taking place. Gases such as carbon dioxide produced by burning of coal, oil, wood, together with industrial pollution, are creating a warm blanket around the earth. This blanket is trapping heat in the atmosphere (the process known as \"the greenhouse effect\"), and so raising the temperature of the earth (global warming).<br> The evidence for global warming can now be seen in the world's changing climate statistics. In Europe, eight of the last ten years have seen record high temperatures. For northern Europe, this has generally been a change for the better. Gardeners can now even grow some tropical plants in England, though London may never see a \"White Christmas\" again. On the other hand, the countries around the Mediterranean Sea, and those south of the Sahara desert are receiving even less rain than before. In sub-Saharan Africa the crops are drying out in the fields and people are dying of starvation. In the Americas, the climate is becoming more extreme -- the summers are getting hotter and the storms are becoming more violent. In 1999 the southern United States was struck by a series of destructive hurricanes, while the end of 1999 saw the worst floods ever in Venezuela. Meteorologists expect such trends to continue, and indeed to worsen, if global warming cannot be halted.<br> In addition to worrying about rising global temperatures and more extreme weather conditions, scientists are closely monitoring sea levels around the world. These are slowly rising, as the northern and southern polar ice caps start to melt. This will have serious consequences for low-lying countries near the sea, such as the coral islands in the Pacific, and Bangladesh where the River Ganges already floods the delta every year. Already parts of these places are disappearing under the rising tides.&nbsp;<br> According to new research, one contradictory feature of global warming is that it will probably lead in the end to a period of much colder weather, at least in Europe. Scientists base their theory on what happened the last time the world warmed up, 8,300 years ago. They have discovered that when the ice melted from the northern polar ice cap it became trapped in an enormous lake in northern Canada. As more ice melted this lake suddenly burst open, releasing millions of tons of freezing fresh water into the North Atlantic. This flood of water was so large that it prevented the normal flow of water in the Atlantic, which takes warm water from the tropics north to Europe. When this flow of warm water was cut off, temperatures in Europe dropped by between three and eight degrees Celsius over the next two hundred years. Scientists believe that a similar process could occur in the next century if the Greenland Ice Sheet starts to melt. \"Ultimately, that's the interest here,\" says Richard Alley, an American climate expert. \"The climate hasn't varied much in 8,000 years. But the big changes could come back!\"<br> <br> <strong>Comprehension Exercise</strong><br> <strong>Select the most appropriate answer for each of the following questions.</strong><br>",

          "title": "<strong>Reading -- the Most Impor</strong><strong>tant Way to Learn English</strong><br> <br> Before you can start speaking and writing in English, your brain must get enough correct English sentences. You can't speak English if you have never seen an English sentence in your life. This is obvious. And you can't speak English well if you have not seen a large number of English sentences.&nbsp;<br> There are two ways to get correct English sentences: listening and reading. Both are good, but reading is usually much easier than listening. With the help of a good dictionary, you will be able to understand English texts much more easily than, for example, English television or movies.<br> If you read just one book in English, you will see that your English has become much better. You will start using lots of new vocabulary and grammar in your school compositions and e-mail messages. You will be surprised, but English phrases will just come to you when you are writing or speaking! Things like the past simple tense and how to use the word \"since\" will become part of you. You will use them automatically, without thinking. Correct phrases will just appear in your head.<br> It will be easy to use English, because your brain will only be repeating the things that it has seen many times. By reading a book in English, you have given your brain thousands of English sentences. They are part of you now. How can you make a mistake and say \"I feeled bad\", if you have seen the correct phrase (\"I felt bad\") 250 times in the last book you've read? You simply cannot make that mistake anymore.<br> This is true for hundreds of words and grammar structures. If you read in English, you can forget about grammar rules. Throw away your grammar book! You don't need to know the rules for the present perfect tense. You don't even have to know the name \"present perfect\". Instead, read a few books in English, and soon you will feel that \"I have seen Paul yesterday\" is wrong, and \"I saw Paul yesterday\" is correct. How? Simple. Your brain has seen the second kind of sentence 192 times, and the first kind 0 times. This is what we call grammar intuition. This is how native speakers know what is correct. It's no magic. You can do it, too. The only difference between you and native speakers is that they have heard and read more English sentences than you have. Many learners have improved their English grammar and vocabulary in an amazing way because of intensive reading.<br> How to Read<br> These great results come especially quickly if you do three things when reading.<br> Pay attention to interesting things: new words, phrases, and grammar structures.<br> Use your dictionary to learn about these interesting things. The more you use your dictionary, the faster your progress. If you don't like to stop reading (to look up a word in your dictionary), you can write down all the interesting sentences, or you can underline them in the book with a pencil. You can learn the words and grammar in these sentences later.<br> Add these interesting things to a memo or notebook. This will give you everyday contact with correct English sentences. With such a memo, you will not forget useful words and grammar. Because of this, you can build your knowledge very quickly.<br> What to Read<br> You should always read English texts which are at the \"right level\". What does it mean? There should be some words that you don't know, because you want to learn something. However, there shouldn't be too many difficult words, because you don't want to use your dictionary 10 times in one sentence.<br> Here are the kinds of texts that you can read in English:<br> Literature. If normal books are too difficult for you, we recommend graded readers. These are usually famous books, written in simple language. There are many levels of difficulty -- from \"easy starts\" (which use only 200 basic English words) to \"advanced\" (3000 words).<br> Science books. If you are interested in science, you can get great science books written in English. There are many famous English-speaking authors in many subjects, such as psychology, biology, physics, or economics.<br> Textbooks. If you're studying at a college and you use textbooks written by English-speaking authors, you can get the original English versions. If you are learning a new computer language, you can use a book in English. You will learn your subject and English at the same time.<br> The Web. On the World Wide Web you are completely free. You can read about every subject in the world -- whatever interests you. Because you will often spend many hours surfing the Web, you can also learn a lot of English.<br> There are also some small things to do. For example, you can start using English versions of your computer operating system, and other applications. You can also find people who will write e-mail in English to you. You should simply read in English as much as possible.<br> <br> <strong>Comprehension Exercise</strong><br> <strong>Select the most appropriate answer for each of the following questions.&nbsp;</strong><br>",
